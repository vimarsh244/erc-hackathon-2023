### Electronics

Part 1:

The differential drive mechanism is a simple 4wd that takes in (linear.x and angular.z) from ROS controller which will accordingly turn the motors.

Combined all tasks in one circuit


#### Coil Mechanism

The Sinosoidal wave produced will be connected to a copper coil. Another copper coil will be receiving the voltage. When connected across a capcitor and near a mine, due to metal eddy currents, there will be changes across voltage in capacitor measured by any ADC converter.


### Automation

Path planner uses RRT to make calculate a path which goes over all points.

Due to time constraints I could not make a good PID controller, just made a simple controller to go from one point to another.
